## Research Methodology

Research was conducted through:
1. **Codebase Analysis**: Review of existing architecture (entity-linking, context-budget, chat modes)
2. **Competitive Analysis**: Feature comparison with leading narrative tools
3. **Industry Research**: Web research on AI context management, validation systems, workflow optimization
4. **Pain Point Analysis**: Review of session reports and documented issues

## Key Findings

### 🔴 High Priority Enhancements
1. **Canonical Context Manager**: Prevents AI amnesia through validation and canonical data store
2. **Hierarchical Worldbuilding**: Nested world structures with automatic context inclusion
3. **Relationship Visualization**: Visual relationship graphs with type tracking

### 🟡 Medium Priority Enhancements
1. **Timeline Visualization**: Canvas/Gantt views for multi-timeline support
2. **Voice Preservation**: Voice-aware generation with consistency checking
3. **Completion Tools**: Gap analysis, checklists, export preparation

### 🟢 Low Priority Enhancements
1. **Series Support**: Cross-project sharing
2. **Forward References**: Link to entities not yet created
3. **Workflow Shortcuts**: Custom commands and templates

## Next Steps

1. Review research findings with team
2. Prioritize features based on user feedback
3. Prototype high-priority features
4. Gather user testing feedback
5. Iterate based on real-world usage
