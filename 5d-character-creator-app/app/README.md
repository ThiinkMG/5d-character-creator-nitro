The **5D Character Creator** is an advanced narrative engine designed to help writers, world-builders, and roleplayers craft deep, multi-dimensional characters. 

Instead of simple static profiles, it uses a **Hybrid Narrative-Trigger System** that pushes you to explore not just *who* your character is, but *why* they exist, *how* they think, and *what* breaks them.

## 🚀 Features & Operational Modes

The system operates through 6 interconnected modes, each designed for a specific stage of creation.

| Mode | Purpose | Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🟩 Basic Mode** | Quick-start for NPCs or lightweight ideas. | `/generate basic` |
| **🟨 Advanced Mode** | Full 5-Phase development for protagonists. | `/generate advanced` |
| **🟦 Simulation Mode** | Stress-test characters in live scenarios. | `/simulate [scenario]` |
| **🟪 Analysis Mode** | Evaluate designs using expert frameworks (Greene, Truby). | `/analyze` |
| **🟫 Worldbuilding Mode** | Build universes, magic systems, and cultures. | `/worldbio` |
| **🟥 Export Mode** | Save outputs to Notion, PDF, or Markdown. | `/export` |

## 📚 The 5-Phase Development Process

Characters are built through a structured evolution:

1.  **Foundation (0-20%)**: Establish the "Bone Structure" (Name, Role, Premise).
2.  **Personality Core (20-40%)**: Define the "Shadow" and internal conflicts.
3.  **Backstory & Origin (40-60%)**: Uncover the "Ghost" (Past Wounds).
4.  **Relationship Web (60-80%)**: Map power dynamics and allies.
5.  **The Arc (80-100%)**: Simulate growth and the final climax.
